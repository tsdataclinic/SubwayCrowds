# Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for development of SubwayCrowds. The aim is to keep this populated with a set of planned tasks and features.

If you would like to request a new feature or prioritize one over the others, open a github issue and we can discuss further.

## New features
-	A low touch feedback process to get more feedback from users.
-	Easily switch between alternate train options. For example: If the selected trip is covered by A, C, and E trains, make it easier for user to compare the crowd on each.
-	Ability for the user to add multiple stops that may include transfers so they can view crowd estimates for the comple commute in one go. For example: 2 Line => 96th St -> Times Square followed by R Line => Times Square -> 8th St NYU


## Exploratory
-	Explore potential improvements to crowd estimating methodology. (ex: as a Max-flow model on a graph)
